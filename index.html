		<h2 style="text-align: center;"> International Mother Language Day </h2>
		<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;"> In the history mankind around the world has many days to remember. International Mother Language Day is one of the memorable days. Every independent nation observes the day in memory of the language martyrs and speaks in praise of the mother tongue. 21 February of every year is regarded as the International Mother Language Day.<br><br>
        On 21 February 1952, during the tome of Pakistani rule some valiant sons of our country laid down their lives for our mother tongue, bangle. Since then, the day had been observed as our shaheed day OUN as the international mother language day.<br><br> 
		21 February is now observed all over the world as a red letter day. In our country it is observed as a national mourning day. The national flag is hoisted half mast to mark the day. People of all classes bring out a procession called “probhat fery”. Everybody in the procession walks bare-footed and sings the song. “Aner bhaer rakte rangano 21 February amiki bhulite pari”. Flowers and wreathes are placed at the foot of the shaded minar to pay homage to the martyrs. Discussions, seminars and cultural shows are organized throughout the country. Our newspapers bring out special features. The TV & Radio put up special programmers highlighting the significance of the day.<br><br>
		This day is of great significance, we have achieved bangle as our mother tongue. The language movement gave us the spirit of liberation and we became independent in 1971. Today we are free and bangle is an important language.<br><br> 
		We should try for the development of this language. We hope that in near future bangle, like English; will be used as a medium of speech in different international forums. </p>
